This article serves as a more comprehensive list of gameplay changing plugins and datapacks installed on the server, please navigate to
each individual section to find out more about each feature.

## Resource World

Resource World is a plugin (or rather a server) which has a world that resets every week, with the sole purpose of being harvested for any
and all resources you may need without having to destroy your home world. Building stuff is not recommended since it will reset.

To access the Resource World, simply type `/resourceworld` in chat, then go through the portal, and when you spawn in the hub, go through
the water portal at the end.

## Terralith (World Generation)

Terralith is a small datapack that adds a plethora of new biomes, and overhauls world generation making for some pretty picturesque
environments, such as sakura groves, floating skylands, mirage isles, the list goes on, jump in and start exploring for a taster of
what Terralith truly has to offer.

### Terralith Continents

On [Onex](onex.md) an expansion of Terralith called Continents is also used, this makes landmasses and oceans much larger, as well as
making ocean monuments and floating skylands a much more common sight.

## Indendium

From the same family as Terralith, Incendium similarly modifies the world generation of the nether, as well as adding extra biomes, 
structures, bosses and more, which make the nether a bit more challenging, but much more rewarding.

## Nullscape

Nullscape, also from the Terralith family of datapacks, adds more biomes and revamps the end, and while not adding any bonus structures,
it does make navigating the end a much more interesting experience.

## Structory 

This is another datapack from the Terralith family which focuses on adding more structures (with slight lore) to the overworld, with
some interesting loot.

## [Slimefun](slimefun/index.md)

Slimefun is a plugin that adds a ton of new gameplay elements and mechanics, all while not requiring any client-side mods, from fruit trees,
to repairing spawners, fancy armour to repairable spawners, nuclear power and huge storage containers, if you can think of it, chances are,
slimefun does it. In fact, it has so many of these elements that it actually has [its own page](slimefun/index.md) on this wiki.
