Resource World
======================================
</div>

Resource World is a plugin (or rather a server) which has a world that resets every week, with the sole purpose of being harvested for any
and all resources you may need without having to destroy your home world. Building stuff is not recommended since it will reset.

To access the Resource World, simply type `/resourceworld` in chat, then go through the portal, and when you spawn in the hub, go through
the water portal at the end.
