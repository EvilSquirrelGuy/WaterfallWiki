## Terralith (World Generation)

Terralith is a small datapack that adds a plethora of new biomes, and overhauls world generation making for some pretty picturesque
environments, such as sakura groves, floating skylands, mirage isles, the list goes on, jump in and start exploring for a taster of
what Terralith truly has to offer.

### Terralith Continents

On [Onex](onex.md) an expansion of Terralith called Continents is also used, this makes landmasses and oceans much larger, as well as
making ocean monuments and floating skylands a much more common sight.

## Indendium

From the same family as Terralith, Incendium similarly modifies the world generation of the nether, as well as adding extra biomes, 
structures, bosses and more, which make the nether a bit more challenging, but much more rewarding.

## Nullscape

Nullscape, also from the Terralith family of datapacks, adds more biomes and revamps the end, and while not adding any bonus structures,
it does make navigating the end a much more interesting experience.

## Structory 

This is another datapack from the Terralith family which focuses on adding more structures (with slight lore) to the overworld, with
some interesting loot.
