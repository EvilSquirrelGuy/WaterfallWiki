Welcome to the official Waterfall Nations wiki, the No. 1 place to find out anything and everything you need to know about the Waterfall Nations Minecraft server.

## What is Waterfall Nations?

We are a Minecraft: Java Edition Semi-Vanilla Server network running on **1.19.3** with a couple [gameplay tweaking plugins and datapacks](#features) that offer a unique twist. With an active staff team and an awesome community behind it, it's a server you'll want to call home.

The network revolves around three "nations" (hence the Nations in our name), of which you can choose one to become your new home, but choose wisely, because once you've chosen one, there's no switching. Each nation has a separate server and worlds, each with their own lore (should that interest you) and slight world generation differences on a few. We also have a resource server (which resets weekly) so you don't have to destroy the landscape in your own world when you want to acquire large amounts of materials.

These are the three nations that you can choose:

### [Ferox](ferox.md)
#### People of the Forest

Ferox is a land taken over by the forest. Will you set off on an adventure to discover all of the different types of wood?

Pink, red and purple trees dot the landscape to offer that little bit of colour amidst the different shades of green. Palm trees grow in the deserts to offer respite from the scorching sun, fruit trees are scattered across the landscape, so you can fill your stomach with sweet, natural treats after a long day of travelling the world. Amidst the dark oak forests grow mysterious giant mushrooms, for that fairytale-like atmosphere and you can observe the majestic spruce trees of the taigas reaching for the skies.

From benign bushes, to towering trees, Ferox has plenty to offer for everyone! And whether you choose to live up amongst the treetops, or down on the ground with the small plants, the forest will always watch over its inhabitants, plants, animals and humans alike.

### [Onex](onex.md)
#### Guardians of the Ocean

Onex is a nation filled with water, and unlike other nations, Onex has special world generation to allow for huge oceans and landmasses to spawn. Additionally, with the increased ocean sizes, Ocean Monuments have been made more common, and you may encounter ships on the vast expanses of water.

Will you sail and explore the endless oceans, in search of coral reefs and shipwrecks? If you're lucky, you might come across the rare and majestic floating islands in the sky, the opportunities are endless.

### [Zelux](zelux.md)
#### Protectors of the Mountains

Zelux is a nation centred around deep caverns and high peaks. Journey across the land to find towering mountaintops and snowy expanses. You could build a base on a ridge, enclosed on all sides by majestic peaks or in the caverns deep underground, here, you can call even the most inhospitable environments home.

Dive into the dark and gloomy depths of the world to search for the glint of diamonds or tame the almighty warden. Sneak around the cold, icy caverns and let the faint light guide you to riches. You might even come across a spawner or a mineshaft left behind by an ancient civilisation.

But wherever you may go, there will always be a goat watching over and protecting you from afar.
